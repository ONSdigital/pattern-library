title: Line Chart
group: Charts
usage: |
  These charts are primarily used in the [Time Series pages](/templates-templates-time-series-page-t5.html).
  In the context of the time-series pages (and ideally most situations), the line chart should be used at full page width so that any onward journey is secondary to the primary requirement of displaying data.
  This is particularly important when considering one of the core design principles of 'itâ€™s all about the numbers'.
  In addition, whilst the charts are responsive, as much space should be given to the chart so that the information can be clearly relayed to the user.
  On resizing, the number of data points that are included in the x-axis are reduced so that the chart displays well on small screen sizes.
