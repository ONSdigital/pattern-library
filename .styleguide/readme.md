# Office of National Statistics Pattern Library (Alpha)

### A library of visual and interaction patterns for ONS digital interfaces

These patterns and UI components were created during the UX design, graphic design and front-end development work for the ONS Alpha site. 

They have been developed with scalability and reuse in mind. 

This site is designed to be both a front-end framework and a toolkit that can be used to develop responsive, mobile-first web interfaces for ONS. It contains supporting notes for designers and front-end developers.

It can be considered a **living style guide** – the code, demos and supporting documentation are generated from the same source files as the front-end production code. It should naturally evolve and provide long term value.

The approach taken to design and development on this project has followed ONS’s [Rules of Engagement](http://onsdigital.github.io/) and the Government Digital Services (GDS) [service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). The patterns, components and pages have been tested with target users, to evaluate their validity as interface components.
