title: Multi Series Chart
group: Charts
usage: |
  Different shaped points are used as well as colour (which are in keeping with the ONS [colour guidelines](http://localhost:3000/visual-language-colors.html) so that colour alone isn't used to indicate which data set the line is applicable to.
  Adding the shapes to the tooltip helps differentiate between the data points.
  All data values are shown in the tooltip (as a pose to the point currently hovered over) as some points may stack.
  Note: The inline height style is shown here as an example.  Inline styles should not be used in production ready code.
